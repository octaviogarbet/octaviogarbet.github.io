    <h3>Meetups and events</h3>
    <p>I give different talks in meetups and events. I really enjoy this because sharing the knowledge we have, is the best way to keep growing as a software developer's community. Some of the talks that I have presented are the followings:</p>
    <div class="cards-container">
      {% for talk in site.talks %}
        <article>
          {{ talk.content | markdownify }}
        </article>
      {% endfor %}
