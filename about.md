# About me

Hi! My name is Octavio, I am 34 years old and I live in Uruguay. I fall in love with technology at primary school and from there I am always learning about technology. I truly believe that Information Technology can contribute to build a better world and I will be having in mind how can I help others with technology.

## Profession

As a Software Development Team Lead and Engineering Manager with over 10 years of professional experience in the IT industry, I possess a deep technical knowledge of web technologies, with a focus on both back-end and front-end applications and architectures.

In my projects, I prioritize the overall quality of the delivery and strive to understand the business needs of different stakeholders, in order to provide the best solutions for our clients. I make it a priority to understand the individual needs of each team member, fostering a positive and healthy working environment that enables them to take on new challenges, enjoy their work, and experience professional growth.

My impact extends beyond my team, as I have presented on various topics, guided colleagues in their careers, and have become the go-to person for front-end related issues in the office. I encourage knowledge-sharing and lead initiatives to facilitate professional growth and develop new leaders across the organization, which has resulted in improved skills for engineers and new opportunities for growth.

In recent years, my leadership role has expanded to managing several engineers across different teams, working collaboratively to identify and leverage their professional interests and goals.

My passion for technology, social nature, industry understanding, and love for working in a team drive me to constantly seek new learning opportunities to improve my communication, technical, and leadership skills, as well as my understanding of the software business.

I am enthusiastic about sharing my knowledge and helping others, as evidenced by my experience as a university teacher and public speaker, where I have presented on a variety of topics at conferences, meetups, and within the organization. Notably, I presented on "Soft Skills and their Influence on Your Career" at the XXVI Ibero-American Conference on Software Engineering (CIbSE 2023), "Pointer, Reference, and Value in JavaScript" at the Montevideo JavaScript Meetup, "Business Model Canvas Tour" as an internal presentation for Endava, demonstrating how we can use the business model canvas for a company, team, and personal career, and "UX 101: Don't Make Them Think" at an external meetup organized by Endava.

## Education

I studied Computing Engineer at Universidad de la Rep√∫blica del Uruguay, having approved 63% of the career. I acquired knowledge in object oriented programming, data structures and algorithms, databases, software design, software engineering, software business, computing architecture, calculus, algebra, probability and statistics among others.

## Hobbies

The life isn't just about code :). I love sports (to watch and also play them), spend time with my family and friends, and drinking Mate (a typical uruguayan kind of te). I play basketball and football since I was a child, sports which I love and which help me to understand the importance of the team and not only individuals.
